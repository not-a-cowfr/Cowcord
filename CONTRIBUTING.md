# Setting up

## Requirements

- [ ] [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [ ] Some non ancient rustc version

## Flags info

### `--profile`
options:
1. dev - fastest build times, little optimization, used solely for development
2. release - smallest binary, made for full releases
3. beta - best performance, a bit more likely to crash

default: dev

### `--platform`
options:
1. web
2. desktop

default: web

### `--release`
mainly just removes the built in dioxus debug stuff

## Testing

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/not-a-cowfr/cowcord.git
cd cowcord
```
2. Install Dioxus cli
```bash
cargo install dioxus-cli
```
3. Run
```bash
dx serve --platform <web|desktop>
```

## Building

### Web

1. Run this
```bash
dx build --release --profile <beta|release|dev> # no needs to specify platform, web is the default
cp -r ./target/dx/Cowcord/release/web/public ./dist
cp ./dist/index.html ./dist/404.html
```
(yes `--release` is necessary even when using beta profile)
<!--
2. Optimize wasm, run this
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y binaryen
wasm-opt dist/assets/dioxus/Cowcord_bg.wasm -o dist/assets/dioxus/Cowcord_bg.wasm -O4 # O4 for speed OZ for binary size
```
-->
2. Done! everything should now be in the `./dist/` directory

### Desktop

1. Run this
```bash
dx build --release --profile <beta|release|dev> --platform desktop
```
idk what else to do, ill fix this part later

# Consistency

<details><summary><h2>Endpoints</h2></summary>

### 1. Declaring Endpoints

If the endpoint has no changing string query fields or a part of the url is not always the same, then define it as a const, like this:
```rust
pub const SUPER_COOL_ENDPOINT: &str = "/super/cool";
```

However, with a lot of endpoints they have something that changes, like maybe a part of the url is a guild id, or it needs some string query parameters, in this case you would define it as a function, keeping the upper snake case, example:
```rust
pub fn SUPER_COOL_ENDPOINT_ENDPOINT(some_id: Snowflake, query: QueryStringParamsStruct) -> String {
	format!("/super/{}/cool{}", some_id, to_string_query(&query))
}
```

Also important, make sure to end the variable/struct/function/type name with what is format
```rust
/// notice the ENDPOINT at the end
pub const SUPER_COOL_ENDPOINT: &str = "/super/cool";

pub struct SuperCoolRequest {}

pub type SuperCoolResponse = SomeOtherThing;
```

And finally, make sure to include important info with the endpoint, for example:
```rust
/// Type: post
///
/// supports Super-Cool-Header header
///
/// requires SUPER_COOL permission
pub const SUPER_COOL_ENDPOINT: &str = "/super/cool";
```

<!-- ### 2. Keep request and response structs seperate, even if they're the same
This is because if in the future if one changes its very easy to edit them and it just -->

</details>

<details><summary><h2>Structs</h2></summary>

```rust
pub struct MyCoolStruct {
    field_one: FieldOneType,
    field_two: FieldTwoFlags,
}
```
```rust
enum_number! {
    #[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
    #[serde(from = "u8", into = "u8")]
    pub enum FieldOneType {
        THIS_COOL_TYPE = 1,
        THIS_OTHER_COOL_TYPE = 2,
        _ => Unknown(u8),
    }
}
```
```rust
bitflags! {
    pub struct FieldTwoFlags: u64 {
        const THIS_COOL_FLAG = 1 << 0;
        const THIS_OTHER_COOL_FLAG = 1 << 1;
    }
}
```
soon these will be used rather than just defining it as an int, and then the docs comment can be removed

</details>

<details><summary><h2>Components</h2></summary>

This ones pretty easy, all it is is that if theres some ui element thats used more than once, in more than one place, make it into a seperate component instead of something built into the page
